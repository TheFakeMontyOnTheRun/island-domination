#The Underfunded Floating Island Inspector

This is a simple game, made -mostly- in a day for the Ludum Dare 31.
It is a interesting exercise in minimalism, being a simple 3D platform game.

Uses -some- C++11, with SDL 1.2, SDL_gfx (for the vector graphics), SDL_mixer (sounds, of course) and SDL_image (for the other screens).

3D graphics were written manually (no OpenGL) and it was partially developed in a Android tablet running Debian thru GNURoot.
It is known to run on Raspberry-pi and even (barely, by a crude OpenGL port) in a Nintendo DS lite.

Yeah, eventually, I wrote a OpenGL demo of it.
